    "- Do not copy and paste graded cells, as that corrupts the notebook's metadata. You may add cells and copy the text of an existing cell to those, for example, if you would like to add test code or modify the given code. However, when the notebook is graded, all code is automatically executed from top to bottom, so you should remove or comment out extra code.\n",
    "- Write answers to questions only in the graded text or code cells.\n",
    "- Edit code only where it says YOUR CODE HERE; do not change the names of functions, methods, and classes; do not change the number or types of parameters; remove `raise NotImplementedError()`. Otherwise, the automatic grading fails, which may result in a deduction.\n",
    "- Before submitting, \"Restart Kernel\" and run the notebook code from the top to clear the state of the kernel and to check that the output is as expected. When notebooks are graded, they are run with a freshly initialized kernel.\n",
    "- Log files may be created when your program crashes. These log files may become so large that they prevent submission. Delete all log files and submit a cleaned-up folder.\n",
    "- You are asked to write well-structured and readable source code. The source code is always used for grading in addition to the test results. Your program passing the provided does not guarantee that your program is correct and that you will receive full (or any) marks."
